cold war game 


too early to say anything yet, thinking about making a small civ style game in SDL


game play:

overall theme:

* old-school "pre-graphics" feeling made with ncurses
* written in C, to make the experiance of creating the game fit the feeling of the game

state management:

* choose an ideology; socialism; nationalism; libertarianism;

* balance resources; finances; public opinion; 

army management:

* customize military; tech; numbers; training
